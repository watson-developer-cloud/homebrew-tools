# Homebrew formulae for Watson Developer Cloud tools

## DEPRECATED: this repo is no longer actively maintained. It can still be used as reference, but may contain outdated or unpatched code. 

This repo is a tap for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the best way to install
command line software on macOS. 

_Taps_ are Git repositories that add _formulae_, package definitions, to Homebrew. 
See the [Homebrew glossary](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Formula-Cookbook.md#homebrew-terminology)
for clarification and more terms.

## Tapping

## Note for IBMers

All formulae in here **must** be command line tools that are _publicly_ and _freely_ available.
However, the tools may be associated with services that are not free services.
